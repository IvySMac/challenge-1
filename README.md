# Challenge 1

## Description

A marketing agency has a great start with their website, but it could use a little more organization and accessibility. I went line by line to see what I could do to tidy things up using the lessons that I have learned. 

## Usage

![a marketing website with the header Horiseon on the top left and navigation links on the far right. Below it shows four people in a meeting room.](./assets/images/screenshot.png)

While the look of the site remains the same, you can inspect the elements to see the finished organization. This can be used for reference in the future.

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
